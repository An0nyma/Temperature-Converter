# Information

Will convert from and into Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Rankine.  

## Opening
The GUI is MacOS tested only. However, it should be compatible with any OS. You can run it by following the steps below:
- `cd [Temp Converter folder location]`
- `python3 temp_converter.py` (requires tkinter & Python 3 to run)

- If you download from the releases, there is a zip file with the MacOS app in it. You can open it with that instead.
